# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

Hi, this is my firs time desining something using code. This challenge is from frontendmentor.io and it has immensely helped me from kickstarting my journey with code.
I figured I will start with learning the basics of HTML and CSS, before moving onto programming languages such as Javascript.

I took around 4 days to finish this, I know that it is quite long but I am quite proud of it. I did view tutorials from YouTube when I got stuck on a certain task. One of which was centering the QR component, as well as making sure the background is similar to the given style guide.

Overall, this was a fun experience and it really had my brain going since I refrain from referencing the tutorials as much as possible, and training myself to think of a way to build it on my own.
